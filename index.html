                   To live a healthy lifestyle, you have to proactively fight the bad habits and it is thus important to know them first.
                    Below are some of the most common unhealthy habits:<br><br>
                    1-Smoking

                    Smoking is one of the most common unhealthy habits around the world. It’s responsible for nearly half a million deaths each year in the United States alone. There are many other problems associated with smoking, including:

                    .Lung cancer
                    .Gum disease
                    .Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
                    .And many other devastating health problems.<br><br>
                    
                   2- Not Sleeping Well
                    Good sleep quality is crucial for your overall wellbeing. It helps reduce stress, improve brain function, improve attention, prevent illnesses and boost weight loss.
                    Major portions of the population have unhealthy sleeping behaviors, or get fewer than seven hours of sleep a night.

                    Not Exercising

                    Most people think that a lack of exercise just means an increase in weight. That’s unfortunately untrue. Weight gain is one effect, certainly, but the effects of lack of enough exercises can also result in high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome (including obesity and abnormal blood cholesterol levels), coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, Type-2 diabetes, low energy levels, poor posture, and many other health issues.

                1.  Healthy diet, which was calculated and rated based on the reported intake of healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, healthy fats, and omega-3 fatty acids,
                      and unhealthy foods like red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium.<br><br>
                
                2.  Healthy physical activity level, which was measured as at least 30 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous activity daily.<br><br>
                
                3.  Healthy body weight, defined as a normal body mass index (BMI), which is between 18.5 and 24.9.<br><br>
                
                4.  Smoking, well, there is no healthy amount of smoking. “Healthy” here meant never having smoked.<br><br>
                
                5.   Moderate alcohol intake, which was measured as between 5 and 15 grams per day for women, and 5 to 30 grams per day for men. Generally, one drink contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol.
                        That’s 12 ounces of regular beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits.<br><br>
